# Dedicated-Microprocessor-to-Find-the-Greatest-Common-Denominator-of-Two-Decimal-Numbers
The aim of this project is to successfully design and program a microprocessor to compute the Greatest Common Denominator from two numbers on an FPGA using VHDL.

**Design Methodology <br />**
-Xilinx ISE used for design using VHDL <br />
-The processor consists of a Datapath and Control Unit. <br />

**Synthesis and Implementation For FPGA  <br />**
-Design synthesised correctly for the retired Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA <br />
-The spartan 3 can be used as reference when deciding an FPGA for synthesis/implementation of this project. <br />
